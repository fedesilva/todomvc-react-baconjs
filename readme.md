# React TodoMVC with Bacon.js and Bacon.model

This example is very much adapted from the [orignal React
TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/react/).

It uses:

* [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js)
* [Bacon.Model](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.model)

in addition to the original example.

It was inspired by the impressive [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om). Note
that if you know ClojureScript you'll want to go with Om instead of this
approach. It is much more performant.

# React TodoMVC Example

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core
> principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify
> what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the
> underlying data changes.

## Running

The app is built with
[JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at
runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the
link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and
visit http://localhost:8000/
